# Algorithmic Trading Strategy: Golden Cross Strategy
## Overview
An algorithmic trading strategy, known as the Golden Cross Strategy, is implemented to automate buying and selling decisions in financial markets. This strategy leverages moving averages, specifically the Golden Cross, to identify potential trends and generate profitable trades. This README provides an overview of the strategy and guides you through the process of backtesting.
## Before You Begin
Before implementing the Golden Cross Strategy, it's crucial to analyze historical price movements. Visualizing closing prices(closing prices vs dates) using a line plot with the last 400 data points helps understand trends, volatility, and patterns in the financial instrument.

## Golden Cross Strategy
### Moving Averages
Moving averages, specifically the Simple Moving Average (SMA), are fundamental to the Golden Cross Strategy.
### Simple Moving Average (SMA)
The SMA is calculated by averaging closing prices over a specific period. For instance, a 50-day SMA represents the average of the last 50 closing prices. Moving averages help identify trends, and crossovers can signal potential entry or exit points.
### Plotting
The strategy's effectiveness is visualized by plotting the closing prices of a financial instrument along with its 20-day and 50-day SMAs. Buy signals (green triangles) occur when the 20-day SMA crosses above the 50-day SMA, while sell signals (red triangles) happen on the opposite crossover.

## Backtesting
### Overview
Backtesting is a crucial step in evaluating the performance of the Golden Cross Strategy using historical data. It involves simulating trades based on predefined rules and assessing profitability, risk, and overall effectiveness before deploying the strategy in live markets.
### Steps
1. Implement the Golden Cross Strategy.
1. Apply the strategy to historical data, simulating trades.
1. Calculate performance metrics, including PNL, win ratio, and risk-reward.
1. Implement risk management rules, defining position sizes and considering transaction costs.
## Risk Management
Implement risk management rules to control position sizes and set stop-loss levels. Consider transaction costs and slippage in your backtesting to make it more realistic.
## Conclusion
The Golden Cross Strategy, backed by thorough analysis, historical data visualization, and comprehensive backtesting, aims to provide a systematic and automated approach to trading. Use this README as a guide to understand, implement, and evaluate the Golden Cross Strategy for algorithmic trading.
